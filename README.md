```bash
$ composer update
$ php artisan smartmotors:update --dev
```

## Local Development (Homestead)

```bash 
# 
$ cd ../
$ git clone git@github.com:FreshinUp/fresh-bus-forms.git
$ php artisan fresh-bus:link
$ php artisan fresh-bus:update --dev
```

### ElasticSearch

```
features:
  - elasticsearch:
    version: 7
        
ports:
  - send: 9200
    to: 9200
```

`.env`
```
ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=http://localhost:9200
```

### Static Content Management (Upload Content)

- add 
```
buckets:
    - name: csm

```
- `$ vagrant up --provision`
- add homestead site to your hosts file:
`192.168.10.10   homestead`

FS_BUS_SECRET=secretkey
FS_BUS_ENDPOINT=http://homestead:9600
FS_BUS_BUCKET=csm-bus
FS_BUS_REGION=us-east-1
FS_BUS_ROOT=
```
- for pbs import add this configuration:
```
PBS_USERNAME=FreshinUp
PBS_PASSWORD=kE18cV22y1r3
PBS_SERIAL_NUMBER=9991.QA
```
